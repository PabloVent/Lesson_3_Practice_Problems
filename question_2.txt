Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby:

When used in methods, '!' indicates that there's a side effect or modification
to the calling object, whereas '?' indicates that the method returns a boolean.

And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?

It's the not equal to operator. Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; 
if they're not equal then the condition becomes true.
It is used in conditional statements; 'if' statements.

2. put ! before something, like !user_name

It flips the truthiness or falsiness of an expression to its opposite. In the given
example, !user_name, user_name becomes falsy.

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!

In many cases (not all), the method call becomes destructive; it mutates the calling
object.
